# 2048 RL Agent â€“ After-State & N-Tuple

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent for the game 2048 using *After-State Learning* and *N-Tuple Representation* 
## Overview

- *Goal*: Train an efficient, interpretable agent for 2048.
- *Techniques*:
  - TD(0) with after-states
  - N-Tuple patterns with symmetry-based generalization

## Highlights

- *93.6%* success in reaching 2048 tile
- *Average score*: ~62,000
- *No GPU required*, fast training
- *Fully transparent* policy logic
